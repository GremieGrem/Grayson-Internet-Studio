		<h2>Fungus Station</h2>
		<p>Located in the Queen's Station in an abandoned Stag Station resides a bug named Willoh. Willoh, although keen to eat anything from berries, fungus, to even other bugs, is here enjoying the fungus in the station to her hearts content. During these trying times in Hallownest, you might be able to ask her to share some of her food as you travel through the abandoned kingdom.</p>

		<h2>Tuk's Refuge</h2>
		<p>A scavenger and pilgrim just like yourself, this time she's searching the Royal Waterways for whatever treasures and goodies she can get her claws on. She's found in one location thankfully and is more than willing to share her food with you. Of course they are quite the acquired taste, being rancid eggs. Not many enjoy the taste but others might see it as a rare delicacy due to their difficulty to harvest.</p>

		<h2>Pleasure House</h2>
		<p>The Pleasure House can be found in the City of Tears. Once going up to the top using the elevator, visitors can hear the ghostly yet angelic singing from the ghost, Marissa, a songstress who was loved and adored across Hallownest's capital. While enjoy what remnants of food they have to offer, you can sit down and relax, listening to her sing. Once finished, you can check out the hotsprings for a much needed break.</p>
