        <h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
        <p>While structured content is all the data compiled into a readable format, semantic html is the the skeleton or base for how the structure will look and act.</p>
        <h2>How do they work together?</h2>
        <p>Semantic HTML sets up the base while structured content goes off of said base to provide more data and further expand upon the 'base'. Similar to the muscles and skeleton in a person's body.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h2>
        <p>Both are what allow you to even create your website in the first place, structure it so that it works accordingly, and organize it to function how you'd like it to.</p>

        <h2>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h2>
            <p>I used to be much more of a perfectionist when I was younger compared to now. Eventually I learned that when making something, first I need to make it happen and then I can start to properly work on it. When I have my final results, what matters to me is if I feel done with it compared to if it's good enough. If you feel done with it, why bother touching it more? You might end up making it worse than you initially thought it to be, there for it should be good enough to be considered as complete.</p>
        <h2>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h2>
            <p>Quoting the article, "The tendency to get more rational when you are forced to wait" is described as Hyperbolic Discounting. One method identified to counteract it is to set specific deadlines for each project, allowing little to no room for procrastination. Personally with my own procrastination it's all about instant gratification. McRaney talks about short-term rewards, something that has worked with me in the past. Usually I do this by setting a timer for 30 minutes and working for that longer. Then I reset the timer and take a break for another 30 minutes. The cycle repeats until the project is finished or my mental capacity to complete said project for the day is spent. Until it's finished, I rinse and repeat over the next few days. </p>
        <h2>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h2>
            <p>As the person making the network I have the ability to give out specific information to those who use the network. I get to choose what information is provided within the network and what doesn't get provided. </p>
