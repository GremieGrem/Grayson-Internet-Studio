            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_(comics)#Main_characters:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,Fone%20Bone,-%3A%20The%20hero%20of">Fone Bone</a> from the 1991 comic series <em>"Bone"</em> is one of the main three characters featured within the story. He shares his adventure with his cousins Smiley
            <br>Bone and Phoney Bone. Considering his childlike nature, being optimistic, naive, and too trustworthy, it feels unlikely that someone like him
            <br>would become a hero, let alone someone who would save the Valley from total destruction. He does hold some heroic traits, being someone who is
            <br>loyal to his friends and family and strong conviction towards doing what he believes is right and helps those in need. He doesn't hesitate to
            <br><br>aid those in need even if it requires him to put himself in harms way or even risk his own life.
            <br>The perspective of the story switches between the three but focuses mainly on Fone Bone's story that he shares with Thorn.
            <br>Fone Bone's story starts off with his cousins. The three of them are stranded in the desert after being kicked out of the city Boneville after
            <br>Phoney Bone's plan to scam the citizens out of their money during his campaign to become mayor failed. The three of them find a map and are
            <br>chased off of a cliff by a swarm of locusts. From here, the three have entered the Valley with Fone Bone being separated from his cousins.
            <br>While in the Valley, Fone Bone is introduced to many of the important characters that will help him through his journey alongside common
            <br>antagonists, some that will be later redeemed and others that will prove to be stubborn foes. The story itself starts off as charming and
            <br>unasuming. It's not until Thorn has a nightmare that turns out to be a repressed memory of her past is the true plot revealed.</p>
