	<h2>White Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>This covers facts, figures, information, asking questions, defining information needs  and gaps.  
“I think we need some white hat thinking at this point ...” means “Let’s drop the  arguments and proposals and look at the data.”</em></h3>
	<p>Information wise, I know how to set up, display, and price commissions. What I need to figure out is how to help artists market and promote their commissions along with teaching them how to value their work. Some things to ask myself are will somebody easily understand how to set up a commissions web page based on the information you are giving? Will they get enough information to decide how to establish their pricing for various levels of artwork? Will they get information on how to display their artwork, and show past examples? Will they learn how to promote their website to get traffic and potential commissions? What payment processors will you use? How many payment processors will you offer to be used? How will you communicate with commissioners? In order to get this information I will look at other commission sheets that others have done and see how they price their work. Ask questions to other artists who do commissions, ask how long it takes them to complete their work and how they price their works.

	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>This covers intuition, feelings and emotions. The red hat allows the thinker to put  forward an intuition without any need to justify it. Usually feelings and intuition can  only be introduced into a discussion if they are supported by logic. The feeling may  be genuine but the logic might be faulty. The thinker has full permission to put  forward his or her feelings on the subject at that moment.</em></h3>
	<p>It's a very personal experience of putting yourself out there since you put your soul into your work. It can make you feel very vulnerable but it allows you to toughen up at the same time when you receive criticism or hate from people trying to make you upset. The people who come to the website might be looking for ways to reach out to me to ask other questions about how to set up their commissions. However, I'm incredibly hopeful and optimistic to be able to help but it’s partnered with crippling anxiety.</p>
	<h2>Black Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>This is the logical negative. This is the hat of judgment and caution. It’s a valuable  hat and the one we use most of the time. It is not in any sense an inferior or negative  hat. The black hat is used to point out why a suggestion does not fit the facts, the  available experience, the system in use or the policy that is being followed. The  black hat must always be logical. </em></h3>
	<p>I'll be focusing on illustrative commission prices instead of general art prices so nothing about music, voice acting, writing. Im limited to only illustrations compared to animation, comics, etc, its a more limited audience that this will be applicable to. Some potential problems are setting up a chat feature but being unable to get to the people. Expectations are that people will have communication but if it's not being monitored and responded to, now I have just made people mad. Some downsides are having to monitor it all the time, having to potentially hire someone to respond to these questions.</p>
	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>This is the logical positive. Why something will work and why it will offer benefits. It  can be used in looking forward to the results of some proposed action but it can  also be used to find something of value in what has already happened.</em></h3>
	<p>More people want to find ways to supplement their income or start an art practice. Fandoms have dedicated communities that like to interact with each other and share their love for games, characters, and music. I will be teaching people how to make money based on their craft. There is educational value, self actualization, self improvement, community building, marketing. To accomplish this I must build the website, research other art sharing platforms, online surveys of artists to see how they promote or sell their artwork to gauge interest and understand what information they would want to see. I could include videos, survey feedback, and FAQ sections.</p>
	<h2>Green Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>This is the hat of creativity, alternatives, proposals, what is interesting, provocations  and changes.</em></h3>
	<p>Other ways to do this include video tutorials with voice over, livestreaming for answering questions/ tutorials. An alternative could be a social media component. To fix some problems I have , I could collaborate with voice actors/video makers/animators/comic makers, etc to make different subsections of the website for different types of commissions. See if there is an AI communications function for initial inquiries and schedule a time frame in which responses will occur along with having an FAQ</p>
	<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>This is the overview or process control hat. It looks not at the subject itself but at the  thinking about the subject. “Putting on my blue hat, I feel we should do some more  green hat thinking at this point.”</em></h3>
	<p>Overall i will be teaching people how to make commission sheets and get others to commission them. My goal is to quickly and accurately share information that allows artists to develop their own sites to earn income and gain attention in fandom spaces. To keep the discussion on track i will establish order of elements of site to be built; set time frames for drafts, edits, finalization; determine responsibilities of any team members; conduct daily/weekly check-ins on progress; and set a date certain for launch. The conclusions i have drawn are to formally structure stuff to be successful (white), ignore the anxiety and just have fun (red), start small, monitor feedback, add to the site if the attention warrants (black), i’ve operated a site in this space before and made income (yellow), reach out to talk with other artists to get their feedback (green).</p>
