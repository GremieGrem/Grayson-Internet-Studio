        <h1>Dinner Invitation</h1>
        <h2>Arkin Sinfael</h2>
        <img src="img/Arkin.png" height="436">
        <p>Arkin Sinfael, also known as Castle, is a retired Bounty Hunter for the Mercenary's Guild. He works as its main bartender. He is the father of Naomi Tenko, his adoptive daughter. I have asked him to come today because being the eldest of the three guests he might have some interesting stories and life experiences to share.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork Potstickers</li>
            <li>Meat Pie</li>
            <li>Peach Cobbler</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Phelo Sova</h2>
        <img src="img/Phelo.png" height="436">
        <p>Maris Sova's son and personal assistant as she governs the Rasum District of the Intrepid. He has a family of 7 children which he takes care of with his two husbands and wife. His children grew up with Arkin's child, Naomi, so he would be able to share stories with him.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Michoteta</li>
            <li>Swordfish Souvlaki</li>
            <li>Medovik</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Theodore Harkin</h2>
        <img src="img/Theo.png">
        <p>Theodore "Theo" Harkin is a CSI working in Glasfar, Scotland. Despite his occupation, he has hemaphobia. He also prefers to be addressed by his last name, disliking his first name for reasons he refuses to disclose. I invited him to see how his humor would bounce off of Arkin's, seeing as they have similar tastes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fried Mozzarella Balls</li>
            <li>Double Cheeseburger and French Fries</li>
            <li>Blueberry Tart with Whipped Cream</li>
        </ul>
