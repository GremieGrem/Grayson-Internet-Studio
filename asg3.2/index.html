    <h1>Assignment 3</h1>
        <div id="QnA"></div>
        <h2>From the Do's and Don'ts of Web Design, provide a link to an example of a violation of number 6 (clickable elements are not obvious).</h2>
        <p><a href="https://userinyerface.com/">This website</a> is clearly satiracle but it makes a point of messing with the user in different ways. The 'NO' is not clickable but acts like it is. On the bottom it prompts the user to "click HERE" with click underlined like it has a hyperlink. You have to actually click the word 'HERE' to continue. The phrase 'next page' is also in a highlighted blue, tricking the user, once again, of a false hyperlink</p>
        <h2>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas? Write a paragraph explanation.</h2>
        <p>One thing the article talks about in part 1 is how storytelling can provide a personal touch. Typically brands these days try to go for advertisements featuring storytelling since it connects with the audience in a way that leaves them still thinking about the ad. There are three elements of story telling in design that come together that can either make or break your design. Aka, how well is resonates with your audience based on what you chose.</p>
        <h2>From Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography: What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design? Provide a link to a good example of hierarchy.</h2>
        <p>According to the reading; they can be established by size, weight, color, style, and placement. A good example of hierarchy is from <a href="">this website</a></p>
    <h1>Creative Brief</h1>
        <p>Often times it is difficult to locate the specific artists that you need for a job. It could be website design, making a movie, animation for a television show, artists are required for the job, but looking across all sorts of social media sites trying to find those who fit your budget and have the proper skill set you need is very time consuming and discouraging. As someone who wants to collaborate with other artists, entrepreneurs, and innovators alike, I find myself stuck. There are websites that are out there that showcase portfolios of other artists such as Behance, Art Station, or Fiverr. They allow artists to reach out to their communities and audiences, but do they encourage other artists to reach out to each other, no matter their medium or specific craft? My main goal is to make a website that brings artists from varying backgrounds together, make networking easier, faster, more effecient. I want creatives to feel encouraged and empowered by how easy it is to just reach out to one another, how accessible it is to find voice actors, vfx artists, background artists, musicians, directors, writers, anyone. During their collaboration, it would be encouraged to share feedback to each other, and their community about what sort of efforts their new colleagues have managed to accomplish. Showcase what you've gotten done so far in the project with a timeline, show potential goals you want to reach.</p>
