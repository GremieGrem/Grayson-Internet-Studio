	<h1>Potential Domain Names</h1>
	<h2>CommArt</h2>
	<h2>ArtQuest</h2>
	<h2>Quarty</h2>
	<h3>Discussion Summary</h3>
	<p>Commart is supposed to be a combination of Commission and Art since the website is going to work as an aid to other artists to look back to when they want to set up commissions. Art Quest is like "Art Questions" but shortened, similarly just the usage of 'quest' is what i like. Quarty is a mix of Arty and q from question along with sounding/looking close to 'QWERTY'.</p>
	<h3>Name Chosen: Quarty</h3>
	<p>I picked Quarty purely because of how weird sounding it is. I also enjoy that it is close to QWERTY and feels a bit on theme since i'm doing a tutorial for digital art commissions specifically and QWERTY is from the keyboard.</p>
