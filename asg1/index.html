		<h2>Semester 1 Project</h2>
		<p>For my semester 1 project I was torn between doing an aggregator of bakeries with their listed food allergies and a website that had all sorts of artist profiles compiled into one site.
			<br>The latter seemed to be more feasible so I have decided to make a website that compiles profiles of all types of online artists.
			<br>Just to name a few, this could be 2D digital illustrators, Background Artists, 3D modelers, Voice Actors, Sound Designers.</p>
