	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>While going through the readings, I learned how recently the internet had not only begun but how quickly it has expanded. Honestly, when the article <em>"Evolution of Web"</em> talked
		<br>about how the internet started having user-generated content in 2006, I was shocked, having expected it to be at least around 1999 or 2000. I also didn't know that the internet
		<br> started with table layouts. I understood that it was simplistic and had heard that it was mostly just for travel websites and information, but I didn't know how that content was
		<br>being displayed or shared.</p>
	<p>Future assignments will be listed here.</p>

		<h2>Semester 1 Project</h2>
		<p>For my semester 1 project I was torn between doing an aggregator of bakeries with their listed food allergies and a website that had all sorts of artist profiles compiled into one site.
			<br>The latter seemed to be more feasible so I have decided to make a website that compiles profiles of all types of online artists.
			<br>Just to name a few, this could be 2D digital illustrators, Background Artists, 3D modelers, Voice Actors, Sound Designers.</p>
