	<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_Token">Sleep Token</a></h1>
	<p>Sleep Token is a heavy metal band that combines elements of pop into their songs. Their band is entirely anonymous and they have created a fictional story about said band.</p>
	<p>I personally enjoy this band a lot because of the general feeling I get when I listen to their songs. I enjoy the singer's voice, it's unique compared to the other bands I have listened to. Sleep Token also offers something new to the heavy metal scene that I haven't seen before so it feels very refreshing. What they do is incredibly new so there aren't any other bands out there that have been able to replicate their style.</p>
