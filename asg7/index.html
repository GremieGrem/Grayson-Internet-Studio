        <h2>Why MatPat for President?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MatPat">MatPat</a> has been a large advocate for change and bettering a generation. He has not only strived to create a platform where people feel safe and comfortable to be themselves but has encouraged curiosity and thought with his videos. He tries his best to be sympathetic and fair to people's issues regardless of their background, more interested in helping people rather than dividing people based off of their backgrounds, interests, biases, etc.
