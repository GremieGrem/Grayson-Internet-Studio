	<h1>Favorite Movies</h1>
	<p>My Yia Yia (Grandmother) raised me on a bunch of Romantic Comedies from the 60's to early 2000's. There are some animated movies in the list that I hold close to my heart because of their artistry and impact on my life as well. Overall, a lot of these movies are my favorite not just because of their stories but mostly because of the memories I share with my grandmother over them.</p>
